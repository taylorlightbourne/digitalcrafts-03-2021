<!-- Create the Holy Grail layout.  This is often referred to as the layout that is followed by many websites 
It consist of a header that spans the entire page
a side bar that takes up one side (your choice) and content that is on the opposite side of the sidebar
This is then followed with a footer that takes up the entire page width as well.

The Holy Grail layout is totes overused.  Now, lets create a slightly different version of it.  Your sidebar will take up the entire 1st column of every row, and your nav will now take 1 column less.  Also your content usually is more verbose, so lets add another content square that is twice the size of the original content square.

Calvin said he likes ads.  You know what, _lets add an AD box_ to your layout.  It will be the right most element.  YOu might have to increase your grid template columns number (example: going from 4 columns to 5 columns) -->
