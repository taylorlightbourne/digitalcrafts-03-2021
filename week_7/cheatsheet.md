# Your node and database cheat sheet!

# NODE SERVER 🗄️

1.  Make you files
2.  `npm init -y`
3.  `npm install express cors pg`, whatever you need
4.  .gitignore
5.  GET YOUR Tools, aka const require stuff(express, pg, etc)
6.  Add node_modules to gitignore
7.  create an instance of express
    `e.g const app = express()`
8.  Use middleware, like `app.use, app.use(express.json())`
9.  Define your port number, aka const PORT = XXXX
10.

```
App.listen(PORT, () => {` `console.log("listening on ${PORT}") })
```

11. RUN YOUR CODE. `node . , node index.js, nodemon` whatever you need to start it. http://localhost:INSERTYOURPORTNUMBER.
12. Make your first route, / , and have it return a string for your response.
    ```
    app.get("/", (req,res) => {
     res.send("Meowdy 😼!")
    })
    ```
    ^ If you want to make more routes, repeat step 12 with different urls

# DATABASE CREATION

13. `psql postgres` in your terminal (this might be `psql -U postgres`)
    ^Remember, SQL has to have semicolons at the end of every line
14. Make a database. `CREATE DATABASE **insert your name of the database here**`, if you did this right, you will see `CREATE DATABASE`
15. Connect to database. `\c nameOfDatabase` (you can get a list of datatbases by doing `\l`)
16. Create the table (aka your table schema). `CREATE TABLE nameOfTable(schema goes in here)`, if you did this correctly, you will see `CREATE TABLE` as a message
17. `\dt` to check and see if you have a relation. If not, you need to remake the table. Go back to step 16

# Connect your database to your node server

18. Create a `db.js`
19. Require pool, aka `const Pool = require("pg").Pool`
20. In a variable, you put in your credentials to your postgres database.
    ```
    const pool = new Pool({
    user: "yourusername", (might be postgres)
    password: `passwordgoesinhere`,
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    database: "databasename",
    });
    ```
21. `module.exports = pool`
22. `Const pool = require("./db.js")` in your `index.js`
23. `pool.query` is then used to send SQL from your server to the database. This SQL that you write is up to your route.
