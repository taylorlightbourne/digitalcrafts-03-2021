Make a todo list in html and css and js
You cannot hard code any event listeners to the html, this has to be done with JS
Has to have styling and layout
You should be able to add a task by entering it into an input filed, and hitting a ADD TASK button
each task will have a checkbox next to it that you can check or uncheck
All the html elements need to be created in JS besides the starter files
