# KEEPING YOURSELF ORGANIZED
# define global functions and variables first at the top of your program
# define Classes next and any unique methods inside of them
# then define your while loop if you need the user to keep doing task until a certain condition is met (remember, your condtion needs to be global, and needs to be re-assigned inside your while loop)
